<h1>Ultralearning - Interactive Review Prompts</h1>

<!-- Chapter 1: Why Ultralearning Matters -->
<orbit-reviewarea color="blue">
    <orbit-prompt question="What is Ultralearning?" 
        answer="A strategy for acquiring skills and knowledge rapidly and effectively through self-directed, aggressive learning methods.">
    </orbit-prompt>
    <orbit-prompt question="What is the main argument Scott Young makes for Ultralearning?" 
        answer="Traditional education is often slow and inefficient. Ultralearning is an alternative that allows for rapid, effective skill acquisition.">
    </orbit-prompt>
    <orbit-prompt question="Think about a time when you learned something quickly. What factors made that learning effective?" >
    </orbit-prompt>
</orbit-reviewarea>

<!-- Chapter 2: Metalearning -->
<orbit-reviewarea color="green">
    <orbit-prompt question="What is Metalearning?" 
        answer="The process of learning how to learn. It involves understanding the subject, finding resources, and identifying the best study strategies.">
    </orbit-prompt>
    <orbit-prompt question="What three questions should you ask during Metalearning?" 
        answer="1) Why am I learning this? 2) What is the structure of this subject? 3) How do people learn this skill effectively?">
    </orbit-prompt>
    <orbit-prompt question="How would you approach Metalearning for a new subject you want to master?" >
    </orbit-prompt>
</orbit-reviewarea>

<!-- Chapter 3: Focus -->
<orbit-reviewarea color="orange">
    <orbit-prompt question="Why is deep focus important for Ultralearning?" 
        answer="It allows for faster comprehension, better retention, and more efficient learning.">
    </orbit-prompt>
    <orbit-prompt question="What techniques does Scott Young suggest for improving focus?" 
        answer="1) Structured Deep Work, 2) Attention Management, 3) Habitual Focus Blocks.">
    </orbit-prompt>
    <orbit-prompt question="How do distractions impact your ability to learn deeply? What changes could you make?" >
    </orbit-prompt>
</orbit-reviewarea>

<!-- Chapter 4: Directness -->
<orbit-reviewarea color="red">
    <orbit-prompt question="What is the principle of Directness in Ultralearning?" 
        answer="Directness means practicing in the same conditions as the final application, ensuring transfer of learning.">
    </orbit-prompt>
    <orbit-prompt question="What are some examples of indirect vs. direct learning?" 
        answer="Indirect: Learning a language through vocabulary drills. Direct: Speaking with native speakers.">
    </orbit-prompt>
    <orbit-prompt question="Think of a skill you're currently learning. How could you make your practice more direct?" >
    </orbit-prompt>
</orbit-reviewarea>

<!-- Chapter 5: Drill -->
<orbit-reviewarea color="purple">
    <orbit-prompt question="Why is targeted drilling important?" 
        answer="Breaking down skills into small, focused drills allows for faster improvement.">
    </orbit-prompt>
    <orbit-prompt question="What is the most effective way to drill a weak skill?" 
        answer="Identify the weakest component, isolate it, and repeat it intensively.">
    </orbit-prompt>
    <orbit-prompt question="What specific skill do you need to drill in your current learning project?" >
    </orbit-prompt>
</orbit-reviewarea>

<!-- Chapter 6: Retrieval -->
<orbit-reviewarea color="yellow">
    <orbit-prompt question="What is the Retrieval Principle?" 
        answer="Actively recalling information instead of passively reviewing it, which strengthens memory.">
    </orbit-prompt>
    <orbit-prompt question="What are some effective retrieval strategies?" 
        answer="Flashcards, self-quizzing, practice tests, and summarization from memory.">
    </orbit-prompt>
    <orbit-prompt question="What retrieval techniques could you implement in your studies?" >
    </orbit-prompt>
</orbit-reviewarea>

<!-- Chapter 7: Feedback -->
<orbit-reviewarea color="cyan">
    <orbit-prompt question="What are the three types of feedback?" 
        answer="1) Outcome-based (right or wrong), 2) Informational (what needs improvement), 3) Corrective (how to improve).">
    </orbit-prompt>
    <orbit-prompt question="How can you ensure feedback helps rather than discourages you?" 
        answer="Focus on informational and corrective feedback instead of outcome-based feedback alone.">
    </orbit-prompt>
    <orbit-prompt question="Where could you seek better feedback in your learning efforts?" >
    </orbit-prompt>
</orbit-reviewarea>

<!-- Chapter 8: Retention -->
<orbit-reviewarea color="lime">
    <orbit-prompt question="What strategies improve retention?" 
        answer="Spaced repetition, active recall, and interleaving.">
    </orbit-prompt>
    <orbit-prompt question="Why is forgetting an essential part of learning?" 
        answer="Forgetting helps strengthen retrieval pathways when information is recalled after delay.">
    </orbit-prompt>
    <orbit-prompt question="What retention strategies could you use in your current learning projects?" >
    </orbit-prompt>
</orbit-reviewarea>

<!-- Chapter 9: Experimentation -->
<orbit-reviewarea color="turquoise">
    <orbit-prompt question="Why is experimentation essential in Ultralearning?" 
        answer="It allows learners to find better methods and break through plateaus.">
    </orbit-prompt>
    <orbit-prompt question="What are some ways to experiment with learning methods?" 
        answer="1) Change study techniques, 2) Alter practice difficulty, 3) Use different resources.">
    </orbit-prompt>
    <orbit-prompt question="Whatâ€™s one experiment you could try to improve your learning approach?" >
    </orbit-prompt>
